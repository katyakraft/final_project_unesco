#4.	Impact of New UNESCO Site Inscriptions on Tourism Growth ### NOT A GOOD APPROACH TO ANALISE IN SQL.

#Hypothesis 4: The announcement of a new UNESCO World Heritage site is associated with an increase in tourism arrivals in the following year, reflecting heightened interest and visitor appeal driven by the siteâ€™s designation. This hypothesis tests whether a new UNESCO listing has a measurable, positive impact on tourism growth.
